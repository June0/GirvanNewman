GirvanNewman
============

I have made this plugin for gephi, an open source applcation used for analysis of network graphs.
url: https://gephi.org/

The plugin uses Girvan Newman Algorithm for clustering of graphs. The research paper can be found on this link:

Few bugs in GirvanNewmanImpl are yet to be solved before I could push it to Gephi's repository.
